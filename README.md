<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This website project was commissioned by our university during the engineering studies to promote the International Entrepreneurship Week. Our goal was to provide information about the event, its program, speakers, and statistics. We also included photo galleries and a summary of the entire event after it took place.

We designed the website with accessibility in mind, incorporating tools to increase/decrease text size, grayscale, underlined links, readable font, and a reset button to default settings. The site proved to be successful and was used for the following two editions of the International Entrepreneurship Week.
